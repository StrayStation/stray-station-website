                    <h2 class="section-title">The Playground</h2>
                    <p>Stray Station is my personal laboratory for exploring AI, building experimental applications, and learning to leverage the technology that's reshaping our future. This isn't a portfolio of perfection: it's a chronicle of curiosity.</p>
                    
                    <p>As a supply chain and operations executive with over 20 years of leadership experience, I've spent my career optimizing complex systems, driving integration strategies, and delivering measurable results. But somewhere between P&L reviews and transformational roadmaps, I found that my peers, business leaders, and even I lacked a full understanding of technology's trajectory; more importantly, how to value and leverage it to stay ahead of the paradigm and push beyond the possibility frontier.</p>
                    
                    <p>Every company I encounter talks of innovation and the future. Few actually do it. Their leaders are comfortable going with the flow, getting rewarded for stepping just outside the box while still holding onto it. My mind didn't want that, but I was seeing myself becoming exactly that: comfortably thriving in the current. But even a dead fish can go with the flow.</p>

                    <p>I needed a forcing mechanism to stop being the dead fish. So I built this station. A place where desire meets curiosity, elation collides with tension, wonder wrestles with anxiety. A place to experiment, to break things, to learn by doing rather than waiting for permission.</p>

                    <h3>The Contrarian Ethos</h3>
                    <p>The name "Stray" isn't accidental. It was given to me by some who know me best. It represents a deliberate departure from the beaten path. While others consume AI through polished interfaces, I'm here to understand what's under the hood. While peers delegate technology to IT departments, I'm learning to build it myself.</p>

                    <p>This is continuous improvement thinking applied to personal growth: identify the bottleneck (my own technical literacy), design the solution (hands-on learning), execute relentlessly, and iterate based on results.</p>

                    <h3>What You'll Find Here</h3>
                    <p>The Lab showcases my experiments: apps that blend practical utility with creative exploration. Some solve real problems. Others exist simply because I wondered "what if?" Each project teaches me something new about AI, development, or the intersection of technology and human experience.</p>

                    <p>This is me, learning in public. No corporate polish. No pretense of expertise. Just a professionally curious executive figuring out how to build the future, one project at a time.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">The Professional Arm</h2>
                    <p>Stray AI represents the convergence of two decades of operational excellence with cutting-edge AI capabilities. Where Stray Station experiments, Stray AI executes.</p>

                    <h3>Building Capable Systems</h3>
                    <p>Technology alone doesn't drive transformation. Integrated systems do. Having spent much of my career integrating operations and organizations while leading lean operations initiatives, I've focused on building sustained capability through a holistic approach:</p>

                    <ul class="expertise-list">
                        <li><strong>Operating Systems:</strong> Structured processes and workflows that create repeatable excellence</li>
                        <li><strong>Management Systems:</strong> Frameworks for decision-making, performance tracking, and continuous improvement</li>
                        <li><strong>Human Capability Systems:</strong> Training, development, and knowledge transfer mechanisms</li>
                        <li><strong>Technology Systems:</strong> Digital tools and AI applications that amplify human capability</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This integrated approach ensures that AI implementations don't become isolated technical projects; they become embedded capabilities that drive sustained business performance.</p>

                    <h3>What We Bring</h3>
                    <p>As a seasoned executive who has delivered $500M+ in synergy realization through post-merger integrations and led complex supply chain transformations, I understand one critical truth: technology is only valuable if it's embedded within capable systems that drive measurable business outcomes.</p>

                    <p>Stray AI doesn't just implement AI tools; we build the integrated operating systems, management frameworks, and human capability structures that allow technology to deliver sustained value. We bridge the gap between AI possibility and operational reality, ensuring that innovation becomes embedded capability rather than isolated experimentation.</p>

                    <h3>Our Expertise</h3>
                    <ul class="expertise-list">
                        <li><strong>AI-Enhanced Operations:</strong> Applying AI to optimize supply chain, logistics, and operational processes</li>
                        <li><strong>Post-Merger Integration:</strong> Leveraging AI tools to accelerate synergy capture and system consolidation</li>
                        <li><strong>Executive AI Literacy:</strong> Helping leadership teams understand and deploy AI strategically</li>
                        <li><strong>Custom Application Development:</strong> Building practical AI-powered tools for specific business challenges</li>
                        <li><strong>Process Automation:</strong> Identifying and implementing intelligent automation opportunities</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>The Stray Advantage</h3>
                    <p>Most AI consultancies understand technology but lack operational depth. Most operations consultancies understand process but lack technical capability. Few understand how to build integrated systems where technology, process, management frameworks, and human capability work together to create sustained performance.</p>

                    <p>Stray AI brings all three. We speak the language of C-suite strategy and shop floor execution. We've held P&L responsibility, managed multi-million dollar budgets, and delivered transformations at scale. We've led lean operations initiatives and built management systems that endure. And we're building AI applications hands-on, not delegating to a technical team.</p>

                    <p>The result: AI implementations that become embedded capabilities, not isolated tools. Systems that adapt and improve. Organizations that build internal capacity for sustained innovation.</p>

                    <h3>Partnership Opportunities</h3>
                    <p>Stray AI is positioned for strategic partnerships with companies seeking to:</p>
                    <ul class="expertise-list">
                        <li>Integrate AI into operational workflows without disrupting business continuity</li>
                        <li>Accelerate post-merger integration timelines through intelligent automation</li>
                        <li>Build custom AI applications tailored to specific industry challenges</li>
                        <li>Develop executive-level AI literacy and strategic deployment frameworks</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>We're particularly focused on manufacturing, industrial equipment, and distribution sectors where operational complexity meets significant AI opportunity.</p>
